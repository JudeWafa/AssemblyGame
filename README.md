# AssemblyGame
A 2-player tic-tac-toe game made with x86 assembly language.

The game is played on a 5x5 grid. The objective is to get your character three times in-a-row horizontally or vertically.

This project was done as part of the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course.

The code can be run on EMU8086.
